    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The infamous Meatball Sub sandwich from the cult classic cartoon, Regular Show</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Some mince(beef) for the meatballs</li>
        <li>A nice long hoagie roll to hold everything together.</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Marinara sauce</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Cheese of your liking (preferably provolone and parmesan)</li>
        <li>breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 large Eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the meatballs: Stir together the breadcrumbs, parmesan, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper in a large
            mixing bowl.<br> Stir in milk and eggs until mixture is a loose, paste-like consistency.</li><br>
        <li>Add beef. Using your hand like a claw in a twisting motion, gently mix the meat with the breadcrumb
            mixture until well combined.</li><br>
        <li>Divide the meat mixture into 2 ounce portions and gently shape into balls about 2 inches wide.<br> (If the
            mixture is sticking to your hands, lightly grease your hands with olive oil to prevent sticking.)</li><br>
        <li>Heat a large Dutch oven over medium heat; add the olive oil.<br> Working in batches of 6 to 8, brown the
            meatballs on all sides, about 1 minute per side, turning each meatball about 4 times.<br> Remove from the
            heat
            and drain the grease from the pot.</li><br>
        <li>Return the Dutch oven to low heat and add the marinara sauce.</li><br>
        <li>Nestle the meatballs into the pasta sauce without stirring. Cover and cook 30 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Gently stir the meatballs, making sure each one is coated in sauce.<br> Cover and cook 15 minutes more, or
            until
            the meatballs reach an internal temperature of 165Â°.</li><br>
        <li>For the sandwiches: Preheat oven to broil.</li><br>
        <li>Slices the hoagies rolls lengthwise, through the center of the rolls.<br> Hollow out about 1 inch of the
            inside
            of the bread, from the bottom pieces of the rolls.</li><br>
        <li>Brush the insides of the bread with the olive oil and place, cut-side up, on a rimmed baking sheet.<br>
            Broil
            until the bread is toasted, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the top halves of the hoagie rolls from the baking
            sheet and set aside.</li><br>
        <li>Add 4 meatballs to each of the bottom halves of the rolls; top with 2 pieces of provolone cheese.<br> Broil
            until the cheese is melted and browned, 1 to 2 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Add more sauce to each sandwich if desired.<br> Sprinkle each sub with parmesan cheese and parsley. Top with
            the
            remaining hoagie roll halves. Serve immediately.</li><br>
