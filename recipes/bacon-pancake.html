    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>From the mind of Jake the dog came this innovative and unusual recipe. <br>The sweetness of the pancake and the
        saltiness of the bacon. Who knew these flavours would intertwine with each other
        so effortlessly?</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cup of All purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp Salt</li>
        <li>295 ml Milk</li>
        <li>1 large Egg</li>
        <li>4 tbsp unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>1 tsp Vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Bacon of your liking</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <p><b>For Bacon</p></b></p>
        <li>Heat up 1 tbsp of cooking oil in a pan over medium heat.</li><br>
        <li>Add your bacon and fry it until nice and <i>crispy.</i></li>
        <p><b>For Pancakes</b></p>
        <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and the salt in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Warm milk in the microwave or on top of the stove until lukewarm, not hot.<br> You should be able to keep
            your
            finger submerged for 10 seconds.</li><br>
        <li>Whisk milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until combined.<br> (By warming the milk slightly, the
            melted butter mixes into the milk instead of turning into small lumps).</li><br>
        <li>Heat a large skillet (or use griddle) over medium heat.<br> The pan is ready if when you splatter a little
            water
            onto the pan surface, the water dances around the pan and eventually evaporates.</li><br>
        <li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, pour milk mixture into the well and use a fork to stir until
            you no longer see clumps of flour.<br> It is okay if the batter has small lumps â€“ it is important not to
            over-mix the batter.</li><br>
        <li>Lightly brush skillet with melted butter (this is optional if you have a high-quality non-stick pan). Use a
            1/4-cup measuring cup to spoon batter onto the skillet.<br> Gently spread the batter into a 4-inch circle
            and
            add your crispy bacon on top of pancake mixture.</li><br>
        <li>When edges look dry, and bubbles start to appear and pop on the top surfaces of the pancake, turn over.<br>
            This
            takes about 2 minutes. Once flipped, cook another 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned and cooked in the
            middle.</li><br>
    </ol>
